# Chapter 8 - Firmware Over The Air

> **From Products to Living Systems**

## **Introduction: The Hardware Transformation**



 \- Traditional hardware's "death sentence" at manufacture

 \- How FOTA breaks the hardware rigidity paradigm

 \- The shift from products to platforms



##  **The Technology Behind Living Products**



###  **FOTA Infrastructure Essentials**



 \- Secure bootloaders and partition management

 \- Differential updates vs. full firmware replacement

 \- Rollback mechanisms and fail-safe protocols

 \- Authentication and encryption requirements



###  **Delivery Mechanisms**



 \- Over-the-air delivery networks (WiFi, cellular, satellite)

 \- Staged rollouts and A/B testing for firmware

 \- Bandwidth optimization and update scheduling



###  **Strategic Advantages of Living Products**
